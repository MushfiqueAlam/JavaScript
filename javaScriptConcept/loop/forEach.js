// for Each loop
// The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element. It is not executed for empty elements. It is not chainable and does not return anything. It is not a good choice for large arrays as it is slower than for loop and for of loop. It is also not a good choice for performance-critical code as it is slower than for loop and for of loop.
